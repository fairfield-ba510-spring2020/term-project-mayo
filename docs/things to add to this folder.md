- The ERD should be a PDF file named "CourseDataERD.PDF" to be dropped in the `docs` folder.
- Also in the `docs` folder, add a Markdown-formatted `CourseDataDictionary.md` file that
- Document each fact table (and associated dimensions) as a separate ERD. Each ERD should be named using the pattern `fact-table-name.pdf` and contain no spaces or other unnecessary punctuation. Store the PDF files in the `docs` folder.
